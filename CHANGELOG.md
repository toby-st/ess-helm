# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.8.1 (2025-08-11)

### Changed

- Update Element Web to v1.11.109.

  Highlights :
  - Add support for the new room version 12
  - Allow /upgraderoom command without developer mode enabled
  - Support for creator/owner power level
  - Various icons and visual changes

  (#663)
- Update Synapse to v1.135.2.

  Highlights :
  - This is the Synapse portion of the [Matrix coordinated security release](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/07/security-predisclosure/). This release includes support for [room version](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/rooms/) 12 which fixes a number of security vulnerabilities, including [CVE-2025-49090](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49090).
  - The default room version is not changed. Not all clients will support room version 12 immediately, and not all users will be using the latest version of their clients. Large, public rooms are advised to wait a few weeks before upgrading to room version 12 to allow users throughout the Matrix ecosystem to update their clients.

  (#639)
- Split the `receipts-account` worker type into `account-data` and `receipts` workers.

  If you've configured `synapse.workers.receipts-account` this is no longer valid and your configuration should be updated to
  setup `synapse.workers.account-data` and/or `synapse-workers.receipts` as appropriate. (#640)
- Remove support for `/.well-known/element/element.json`.

  It isn't used by clients of ESS Community.

  If you've set it, please remove `wellKnownDelegation.additional.element` from your values files. (#641)

  (#575)
- Upgrade Synapse to v1.133.0.

  Highlights:
  * Add support for the [MSC4260 user report API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4260)

  Full Changelog:
  * [v1.133.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.133.0)

  (#577)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v0.18.0.

  Full Changelog:
  * [v0.18.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

  (#578)
- Document how to re-run integration tests from scratch. (#579)
- Better document uninstallation of, and the stores of state managed by the chart. (#585)
- Don't push chart OCI images for every PR. (#589, #591)
- Tweak changelog sections ordering. (#600)

### Fixed

- Fix Matrix RTC SFU `ServiceMonitor` not working. (#569)
- Fix Matrix Authentication Service not using the `hostAliases` set in the values. (#573)
- Fix Matrix RTC Authoriser not having default `hostAliases` values. (#573)
- Fix Postgres and Synapse Media `storageClassName` configuration not being respected.

  **Warning** Previously `synapse.media.storage.storageClass` and `postgres.storage.storageClass`
  were in the values file and associated schema. These values were accidentally silently ignored
  and all chart-managed `PersistentVolumeClaims` were constructed without `spec.storageClassName`
  set, using the cluster default `StorageClass`.

  The values file and associated schema have been updated so that the values are now
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` and `postgres.storage.storageClassName`. The previous
  values are disallowed by the schema. Setting these values after the initial install could 
  cause the `PersistentVolumeClaims` to be recreated, with associated data-loss. Only set
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` or `postgres.storage.storageClassName` on initial
  installation. (#582, #583)

### Removed

- Remove Matrix RTC Authoriser `ServiceMonitor` as the Authoriser has no metrics endpoint. (#569)
- Remove `hostAliases` support from Matrix RTC SFU as it doesn't make outbound requests. (#574)

### Internal

- CI: test that the default values includes stub settings (and thus comments) for various properties. (#573)
- CI: test that `hostAliases` are correctly set for all workloads that make outbound requests. (#573, #574)
- CI: improve the test cluster setup for Matrix RTC. (#579)
- CI: improve testing of chart managed `PersistentVolumeClaims`. (#582)
- CI: test nodeSelectors are appropriately configured. (#583)
- CI: simplify which commit we checkout. (#586)
- CI: switch to using `pull_request` triggers. (#586)
- CI: don't push artifacthub metadata on PRs. (#589)
- CI: be explicit about what permissions are workflow/job requires. (#589)
- CI: allow dyff job to work on forks. (#589, #594)
- Tests: don't check services matching labels against terminating pods. (#595, #598)
- Add `yamllint` ct dependency to poetry.toml. (#596)
- Prepare for 25.7.0 release. (#597)
- CI: run the preview-changelog job on main and manually as well as PRs. (#599)
